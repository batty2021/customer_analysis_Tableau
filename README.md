Tasks TODO:
- Revenue per state:
 where ever the color gets darker the concentration is High.

- Revenue based on month of the year:
first i cahnged the datatype string into Date datatype inorder to get the revenue by each month
as we can see in December  had highest revenue followed by April

- revenue based on age:
 between the Age of 30-40 make greate revenue.

- Quantity - Discount percentage correlation:
since both colomns[[Discount Percent],[Qty Ordered] are measures i should of change to dimentions so tableau can perform a function
as we can see a pattern performed here , as discount percentage increasing the Qty Ordered also increasing meaing there is positive correlation 

- Percentage of revenue per Region:
this dona chart shows us South Region had high revenue
- revenue per category per Gender:
this buterfly chart shows female revenue had a bit hiegr than male revenue on Mobaile and Tablet catigory , however they are directly correlated most of thier product revenue.
